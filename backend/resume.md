## Short Bio

I&#39;ve been working with open source software since around 1995, when I first installed Slackware on my computer after getting tired of the constant issues Windows 95 would have.  Having used Solaris at a friend&#39;s house (his father used it for work), I decided to look for a Unix-like I could run.  I stumbled across Slackware, and have used Linux as my primary operating system ever since.  I still try out other OSes, it&#39;s a hobby of mine.

After using Slackware for about a week I decided I wanted to contribute something back, and started learning all I could about programming and package management solutions.  Having had experience with C in school (which I later learned was unusual, as most schools jump from BASIC to C++), I started coding an improved yet backward-compatible package manager for Slackware.  It never made it in to Slackware officially, but it was a good start.

I&#39;ve loved programming since playing with LOGO and QBASIC as a kid, and open source work meant I could use it for something that would actually help people.  So I&#39;ve tried to contribute back to most of the open source projects I use, as well as creating open source projects of my own.

I have created and still maintain a number of semi-widely used open source projects; including applications like indicator-keylock (which is now included in Ubuntu Linux) and backend web packages like django-bootstrap-themes (used internally by Facebook, among others).
